This system is a HALL booking software project. It includes all the features and functions
needed to efficiently manage a HALL.It includes an administrator account which is used
to handle/control all the system functionality. The system keeps track of HALL status and
advance bookings.
The system keeps records of HALL bookings along with associated event details
and user contacts in a well-maintained database. The administrator can easily check the
HALL bookings in the system GUI. Each department has the username and password to
book the hall for their requirement.
This provides a user-friendly environment while booking the hall it gives
suggestions regarding the selection of seminar hall based on the capacity and availability.
The Concern department head can view the list of the request. The acceptance and
rejection can be viewed by the user through that log in or even by the email id.
The system is user-friendly, easy to use and customizable, which makes it
suitable for any organization or institution that frequently hosts events and needs to
manage the scheduling and use of their halls and conference rooms.
